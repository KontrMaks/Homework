# Peperoni pizza recipe

*Method*

STEP 1
Put the flour and yeast in a large bowl. Add 1 tsp sugar and 1½ tsp salt, and mix to combine. Add 300ml tepid water and 2 tsp of the oil, and mix with your hands or the dough hook attachment of a stand mixer until a dough forms. If making by hand, tip the dough onto a work surface and knead for 10 mins until the dough feels smooth and elastic, or knead using the mixer for 5 mins.

STEP 2
Clean and lightly oil the bowl, tip in the dough and leave to prove in a warm place for 2 hrs, or until roughly
doubled in size. You can also put it in the fridge overnight – just bring it up to room temperature before shaping.

STEP 3
Loosely line a 22cm cake tin or ovenproof frying pan with a disc of baking parchment and sprinkle 1 tsp of the polenta over the base. Scatter the remaining polenta over a work surface along with some flour (add more if it begins to stick) and tip the dough on top. Roll and stretch the dough into a rectangle, about 35 x 45cm. Spread the pizza sauce on top, then scatter over the cheese, pepperoni and basil. From the longer side, tightly roll up the. dough to make a sausage shape. Use a sharp knife to cut it into eight pieces, and arrange cut-side up in the tin or pan. Cover loosely and leave to prove for another 30 mins until the rolls look light and puffy.

STEP 4
Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Bake the rolls for 30-35 mins until golden brown and the cheese is oozing. Cool for 5 mins before serving. Best eaten within 24 hrs.
